# UI Component Library for React 19

## Overview

As part of the React 19 upgrade process, we've developed a comprehensive UI component library to enhance the application with consistent, accessible, and reusable components. This library leverages React 19's metadata features and modern component patterns.

## Components Implemented

1. **Button Component**
   - Multiple variants: primary, secondary, tertiary, danger, success, warning, info, link, ghost
   - Size options: small, medium, large
   - States: loading, disabled, full-width
   - Icon support with positioning options
   - Fully accessible with keyboard navigation

2. **ErrorState Component**
   - Standardized error display across the application
   - Multiple variants: inline, card, page, toast
   - Size options for different contexts
   - Built-in retry functionality
   - Accessible error presentation

3. **LoadingState Component**
   - Multiple loading types: spinner, skeleton, progress
   - Size variations
   - Optional overlay mode (container or fullscreen)
   - Accessible loading indicators with proper ARIA roles

4. **FileInput Component**
   - Support for single file, multiple files, and directory selection
   - Drag and drop functionality
   - File preview
   - File type and size validation
   - Accessible file input with clear feedback

## Integration

The components have been integrated with the following parts of the application:

1. ProjectUploader - Updated with modern UI components
2. VectorExplorer - Updated with consistent error and loading states
3. FunctionGraph - Improved error handling and loading states

## Demo Page

We've created a dedicated demo page (`/ui-demo`) that showcases all components with their variants and states. This page serves as:

1. A visual reference for developers
2. A testing ground for component behavior
3. A demonstration of component usage patterns

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been added:

1. Component props and usage examples
2. Best practices for implementation
3. Accessibility considerations
4. Examples of component composition

## React 19 Features Utilized

1. **Component Metadata** - All components export their metadata for documentation generation
2. **Document Metadata API** - Used in key components for SEO and document control
3. **useFormStatus** - Implemented in form components for better form feedback
4. **Custom Hooks** - Enhanced with React 19 patterns, like useFetch

## Next Steps

1. Continue migrating remaining components to use the new UI library
2. Add more specialized components as needed
3. Implement comprehensive testing for all UI components
4. Consider creating a Storybook instance to further document component variants

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - Unified look and feel across the application
2. **Maintainability** - Centralized styling and behavior
3. **Accessibility** - Built-in accessibility features
4. **Developer Experience** - Clear patterns and documentation
5. **Performance** - Optimized components with React 19
6. **User Experience** - Consistent feedback and interaction patterns
