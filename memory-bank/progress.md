## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Python Dependency Challenges**: The advanced vectorization sometimes fails if NumPy isn't available
   - Solution: We've implemented a simplified vectorization as fallback

2. **Performance with Large Repositories**: Processing large repositories can be slow
   - Solution: We're working on batch processing and optimization

3. **Upload Size Limitations**: Very large folders may cause timeout issues
   - Solution: We're implementing chunked uploads and better progress tracking

4. **Windows Path Issues**: Some Windows environments have path handling issues
   - Solution: We've updated path handling to be more robust across platforms

5. **Python Environment Issues**
   - The application reports "Python was not found" errors but continues to function
   - This may cause issues with vectorization processes that require Python

6. **React Hook Dependency Warnings**
   - Several ESLint warnings remain in FunctionGraph.js related to missing dependencies and unused variables
   - These should be addressed to improve code quality and prevent potential bugs

7. **Function redeclaration in project.controller.js**
   - There's a SyntaxError for 'runPythonScript' being redeclared
   - This needs to be fixed to avoid duplicate function declarations
