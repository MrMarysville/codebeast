# Active Context: Hybrid Encoding System with Enhanced User Experience

## Current Focus
We've completed the implementation of the Hybrid Encoding System for Code Beast, including both backend services, frontend visualization components, and a comprehensive testing suite. We've expanded language support with Java and C++ implementations, and have enhanced JavaScript/TypeScript support to better handle React components and JSX syntax. We've completed the React/JSX component relationship visualization, providing a powerful tool for understanding React application architecture. We've also fixed critical issues in the backend project controller to ensure all project-related API routes function correctly.

Most recently, we've completed the upgrade to React 19, removing all Python dependencies and streamlining the application architecture. Major accomplishments include:

1. **Successful React 19 Upgrade** - Completed the migration to React 19.0.0, with all components now compatible with the new version.

2. **Python Dependency Removal** - Eliminated all Python dependencies from the system, making the application more self-contained and easier to deploy.

3. **Streamlined Startup Process** - Simplified the server startup process, with separate commands for frontend and backend.

4. **Package Cleanup** - Removed unnecessary packages and dependencies, resulting in a leaner and more maintainable codebase.

5. **React 19 Compatibility** - All components were verified as compatible with React 19 using the upgrade script, with no changes needed.

Our previous work addressed significant stability issues in both the backend and frontend. On the backend side, we fixed the route handler errors by properly implementing controller functions in project.routes.js and projectRoutes.js, ensuring that all routes use the correct controller functions. We've also added proper implementations for the language detection and graph data endpoints in the vector service, enhancing the application's ability to filter and display function relationships.

On the frontend side, we've fixed React Hook dependency issues in several components, including FileTree.js and FileViewer.js, by using useCallback for functions referenced in useEffect hooks and adding them to the dependency arrays. We've also cleaned up unused imports in the FunctionGraph.js component to reduce warnings. These changes improve code quality and prevent potential bugs related to component rendering and state management.

We're enhancing the Hybrid Encoding System's visualization capabilities, specifically focusing on the integration between the `VectorExplorer` and `FunctionGraph` components to provide a more interactive and informative code visualization experience.

We've completed a comprehensive codebase cleanup and upgrade to React 19. This effort included removing duplicate files and packages, standardizing naming conventions, and implementing new React 19 features. The major changes include:

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Consolidated dependencies across the codebase
   - Upgraded to React 19 and updated related packages
   - Removed duplicate dependencies between frontend, backend, and root package.json files

2. **Codebase Cleanup**
   - Standardized file naming conventions to kebab-case
   - Merged duplicate route and controller files
   - Cleaned up uploads directory
   - Organized imports consistently

3. **React 19 Features Implementation**
   - Implemented automatic JSX runtime
   - Added support for the new Document Metadata API
   - Updated form handling with the useFormState hook
   - Configured asset loading for improved resource management

4. **Build Configuration**
   - Updated Babel configuration for React 19
   - Enhanced Jest setup for testing
   - Added scripts for easier management

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the React 19 upgrade
   - Added comments to explain new patterns
   - Updated memory bank with the latest changes

These improvements have significantly enhanced our codebase's maintainability and performance, as well as positioned us to take full advantage of React 19's new features.
